# fluid

Well, almost nothing's here.
The prototype of the project is put into the file `fluid.py`,
on which I think many things can be improved.

I'm going to make it OOP-FP combined to adjust more situations.
Grid and variables, physical process, border conditions and numerical methods
should be seperated into organic parts.
And I'm working.
